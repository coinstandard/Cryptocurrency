## Definition Of Revolution
- A forcible overthrow of a social order, in favor of a new system

## Why This Cryptocurrency Doesn't Meet The Term
- In 1971, Nixon went against the gold.
- This led to the United States (Treasury) printing whatever they wanted without backing it by a physical/tangible asset
- Which mostly caused the inflation we have since.

## Who Is To Blame
- Definitely Nixon.

## How Do We Fix It?
- Back the dollar by gold again.

## How Do We Start?
- As of 31 July 2020, Fort Knox holds 147.34 million troy ounces (4,583 metric tons) of gold reserves with a market value of US $290.9 billion.
- So this cryptocurrency will have a digital cap of $291 billion.
